# Quorum-tessera-alpine

This Docker image contains Quorum, [Tessera](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera) and I also included the [Istanbul tools](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/istanbul-tools) 
that can be required to generate the extra data field of the genesis when we want to run Quorum with [Istanbul](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/650).

The Docker image is built using multi-stage builds that also improve readibility.
